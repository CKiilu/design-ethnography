#DESIGN ETHNOGRAPHY

When people lack knowledge on other cultures, they make decisions bbased on their own cullture, values and experience.
This brings up issues in the global marketplace.

Anthropologists(prople who study people) have made some sense of local cultures around the world by
observing and participating in activities of everyday life. They have been merchants of astonishment by telling
tales of the lands they traversed.

These days, while working in corporate settings, design ethonographers look deeper into what people do, tools they use
and their ideologies to better understand how to make and sell products targeted at them.

        Note: People in corporate settings are most likely to question this job's importance.
              Ethonogrphy is a methodolgy used to represent the perspective of everyday life.

Design ethonogrphy focuses on the broad patterns of everyday life for conception, design and development of new products
and services as opposed to designs created by people completely submerged in their work culture.

##WHY DESIGN ETHNOGRAPHY

Design ethnography relies on fieldwork and participant observation as basic grounding principles. However, ethnographers
are constrained by business demands and time constraints. Therefore, they are forced to draw on a wider range of tools
including interviews, geneologies, social mapping, demography, photography,documentary making,observation, arvshival 
research and deep hanging out to shape their sensibilities, understanding and knowlrge.

The basic assumption of design ethnography is that people are social beings, not just consumers.

The reasons why design ethnography is necessary are that:

#####1. TO DESIGN WHAT CONSUMERS NEED

This is opposed to relying on developer organisations("if we build it they'll come") and marketing organisations("A 
number of our respondents wish for a better product").

Design ethnography is a way of understanding daily life to increase success probability of a product from 
understanding users.

#####2. IT INTERRUPTS THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE WORK AND THE HOME ENVIRONMENT

It provides designers and engineers a language in which they can talk about experiences and 
behaviours which are critical to life. This bridges the gap between how they present themselves at work and how the 
products they produce are to beused in everyday life.

##CASE STUDY: THE TABLE IS LIFE(__La tavola e la vita__)

In Italy the dining room table is the central place of a family unlike in America where the family room takes that place.
This presents a difference in how products designs will be made in the two different cultures.

Similarly Italians do not drink water out of porcelain cups and insted use glasses as porcelain cups are used for coffee.
Even gelataria(Italian ice cream shops) are more aesthetically appealing and formal looking than American ones. Moreover, 
household provisins are acquired through relatives in the related professions.

Drink marketting in Italy can be work if the drink is advertised to be taken after the meal as is traditional,
 otherwise the product may not fit in with established eating a nd public social eating functions.
 
##TYPES OF RETAIL ECOLOGIES
 
###MAINTENANCE
 
 Doing shopping as efficiently as possible, to get what you need.
 
###CONSUMPTION
 
 Shopping to fel good; for exmple, hobbies.
 
###PROVISIONAL
 
 Buying things for others
 
###PILGRIMAGE
 
 An outing.

##CONCLUSIONS
 
Managing ethnographic work requires one to understand there is no shortcut nor set method to getting results.
ALl studies require different methods to fix them

The industry also requires ethnographers to find new ways to present their work to others in ways that
makes sense to designers, engineers and product managers so  relevant information about cultures is not 
left out during design of products.
